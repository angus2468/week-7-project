I completed all of the base requirements and also completed the stretch goal of adding dynamic pages so the navigation feels smooth.
I also made it so you can filter through the geners so that you can see which moves are in each genre, I did not have the time to be able to add genres and be able to link them with the movies.
This is a rushed project and given more time I would add the genres and movies linking along with some styling.
